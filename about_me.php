		<p>Greetings to all viewers!!</p>
		<p>Homoepathy, as stated by its creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hahnemann" target="_blank">Samuel Hahnemann</a>, is based on the ideology of <i> like cures like </i>. This means that substance that causes symptoms of a disease in a healthy individual is likely to become the cure for similar symptoms in a sick individual.Having a professional practice of more than 30 years in Homoeopathy based on this ideology I wish to offer my experience in Homoeopathic treatment to you all.</p>
